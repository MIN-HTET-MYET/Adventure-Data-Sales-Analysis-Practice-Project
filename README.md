# Adventure Data Warehouse Sales Analysis

A hands-on SQL learning project based on Microsoftâ€™s **AdventureWorks Data Warehouse**.  
This project explores sales performance, customer insights, and promotion analysis to strengthen SQL skills and understand how data warehouses support real-world business intelligence.

---

## Project Overview
This project is part of my SQL learning journey.  
I explored how to:
- Write complex `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` queries  
- Use `JOIN` to connect fact and dimension tables  
- Apply `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` effectively  
- Calculate metrics like total sales, top customers, and promotion performance  
- Understand how SQL supports data-driven business decisions

## Dataset
**Database:** AdventureWorksDW (Microsoft sample data warehouse)  

**Tables most used:**
- `FactInternetSales`
- `FactResellerSales`
- `DimCustomer`
- `DimPromotion`
- `DimCurrency`
- `DimEmployee`

---

## Example Questions Solved
- Who is the customer that spent the most online (USD)?  
- Which promotion generated the highest reseller sales (Euro)?  
- What percentage of current employees are married vs single?

## Tools & Skills
- AzureDataStudio  
- SQL Queries (Joins, Aggregations, Top, Ranking, Filters)  
- Data Warehouse Concepts (Fact & Dimension Tables)

## Key Learnings
This was my first hands-on SQL analytics project.  
I learned how to break down business questions into logical queries, connect multiple tables, and turn raw data into meaningful insights.  
Even though it was challenging at first to think about how to structure each query, getting the correct results made it a truly satisfying experience.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
I plan to continue applying these SQL techniques to real-world datasets and integrate them with tools like **Power BI** or **Python** for deeper analysis and visualization.
